# my little repo of shared ai scripts

This repository is a treasure trove for anyone fascinated by the intersection of AI and shell scripting. These scripts blend humor, practicality, and the superior use of AI tools in shell environments.

For devs, scientists, hobbyists

### Script Spotlight: `ai-dad-joke-rater.sh`

One of the standout scripts in this collection is the [[ai-dad-joke-rater.sh]]. This Bash script utilizes AI to not only generate dad jokes but also to rate them based on humor and cleverness. It's a fun and light-hearted way to see AI in action, with a touch of "humor".

#### How it Works

1. **Joke Generation**: The script first prompts an AI model to produce three dad jokes.
2. **Joke Evaluation**: Each joke is then passed back to the AI for a rating and a brief review.
3. **Interactive Fun**: The output includes both the jokes and their ratings, offering an amusing glimpse into AI's sense of humor.

#### Sample Output
```
cur: 1. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
Rating: 5 - "A classic that always gets a laugh..."

cur: 2. I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised.
Rating: 4 - "An unexpected twist at the end!..."

cur: 3. Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!
Rating: 5 - "Classic and still brings a smile every time..."
```
