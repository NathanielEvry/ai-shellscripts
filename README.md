## Script Spotlight: `ai-dad-joke-rater.sh`

This script offers a blend of technology and humor by generating and rating dad jokes:

### How it Works

2. **Joke Evaluation**: Each joke is evaluated by the AI for its humor and cleverness.
3. **Interactive Fun**: Enjoy the jokes along with their AI-provided ratings.

### Sample Output

1. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
Rating: 5 - "A classic that always gets a laugh..."

2. I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised.
Rating: 4 - "An unexpected twist at the end!"
