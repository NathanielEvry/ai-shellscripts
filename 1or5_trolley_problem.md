A modified trolley problem

You wake up on train tracks, a remote control in your possession. You look to the side and see five identical "you" laying on parallel tracks. You know for a fact they are identical and they have the same memory up until this very moment. None of you know who the original is. 

Right now the train is heading for the other track. If you do nothing, if you do not press the button; You will live, but not the five. If you press the button on your remote; the incoming train will change tracks, hit, and destroy you, the one perceiving the choice. It will then spare the other track giving them time to escape. Do you press the button?
